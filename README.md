# Machine Learning Projects

This repository contains my machine learning projects. It includes work on regression, classification, clustering, feature engineering, and model evaluation. Each project is designed to demonstrate practical problem-solving with machine learning techniques.

## Projects
The Projects folder contains independent machine learning projects where I used Python, Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, and visualization libraries to build and evaluate models.
